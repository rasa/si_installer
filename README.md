# si_installer [![Flattr this][flatter_png]][flatter]

si_installer downloads and installs the freeware applications
available at http://sysinternals.com.

si_installer looks in the directory where si_installer.exe is for
any files it needs before attempting to download them. If it does download a
file, it will attempt to save a copy of the file in this same directory.

si_installer adds the installation directory to your PATH environment variable.
On 32-bit systems, this directory is usually `C:\Program Files\SysInternals`.
On 64-bit systems, this directory is usually `C:\Program Files(x86)\SysInternals`.

If the program is a Windows GUI application, an icon is created in the
`C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Start Menu\Programs\SysInternals`
directory.

The following EXEs are copied to `C:\Program Files\SysInternals`, but do not
have icons:

* Fundelete.exe
* RemoteRecover.exe

These EXEs are installers, that you will need to run, to install the
application.

Applications that require Windows 98, ME, or NT 4.0, are not included.

Note: you are responsible to verify that each program you install using
si_installer is designed to work in your environment.
If you are unsure, then please visit http://sysinternals.com for more information.
